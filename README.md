- I am DuskNotSolar
- Someday I hope to work in cybersecurity
- I'm only in high school but I have dreams and thought this is a good place to get a feel of things related to programming
- I want to follow open source projects I use and hope to learn a few things on the way
- You can reach me via nothing.
